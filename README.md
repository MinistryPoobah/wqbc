Water Quality Thresholds and Index Calculations for British Columbia
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The `wqbc` R package calculates water quality thresholds and water quality indices and plots water quality indices spatially and temporally for British Columbia.

This package was written for the B.C. Ministry of Environment by [Poisson Consulting](http://www.poissonconsulting.ca/). Ministry of Environment staff maintain the package.

### Usage

For information on use, please see the [vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/bcgov/wqbc/master/inst/doc/wqbc.html). In your R session, you can type `vignette("wqbc")` to see the vignette.
