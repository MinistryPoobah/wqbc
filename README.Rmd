## Water Quality Thresholds and Index Calculations for British Columbia

The `wqbc` R package calculates water quality thresholds and water quality indices
and plots water quality indices spatially and temporally for
British Columbia.

This package was written for the B.C. Ministry of Environment by [Poisson Consulting](http://www.poissonconsulting.ca/). Ministry of Environment staff maintain the package.

### Usage

For information on use, please see the [vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/bcgov/wqbc/master/inst/doc/wqbc.html). In your R session, you can type `vignette("wqbc")` to see the vignette.

# install the devtools package if it's not already installed
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("bcgov/wqbc", build_vignettes = TRUE)
# Using `build_vignettes = TRUE` will slow down the install, but is necessary if
