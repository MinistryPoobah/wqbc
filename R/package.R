#' The wqbc package calculates water quality thresholds and indices for

#' package creator's knowledge the limits correspond to the
#' approved Provincial thresholds on the date of
#' release but wqbc comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. For further
#' information on the use of the wqbc package please type
