#' Test for Trends in Water Quality Indices
#'
#' Tests for linear and non-linear trends in water quality indices
#' 
#' [DRAFT]
#'
#' If the argument \code{x} must have columns: 
#' WQI (0 to 100), 
#' Year (or whichever single column is specified by the argument Year). 
#' 
#' only one WQI value for each year is allowed. 
#' If a by argument is specified for example if by = c("Lake", "Site") 
#' then a trend test is conducted for each combination of Site
#' within each Lake by Year 
#' 
#' The function returns an object of class wq_trend which inherits from data.frame. It
#' the will include any columns listed in the \code{by} argument plus any columns which do
#' not vary for each Trend test (allows things like Lat and Lon to be passed
#' through for plotting particular sites) plus the columns From and To which give
#' the first and last Year for each trend test plus the column Values which gives
#' the actual number of WQI values in the test plus the columns Trend (which
#' gives the positive or negative net rate of change per scale unit) and
#' Significance (p-value).
#'
#' @param x data.frame with columns WQI and time defined in \code{scale}
#' @param scale the time stamp of the observation which must be a named column of \code{x}
#' @param by a factor or a list of factors, which must be named columns of  \code{x}.
#' @export
