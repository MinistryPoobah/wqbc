\title{Set value for 'non-detects'}
\usage{
set_non_detects(value, mdl_flag = NULL, mdl_value = NULL,
  mdl_action = c("zero", "mdl", "half", "na"))
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{a numeric vector of measured values}

\item{mdl_flag}{a character vector the same length as \code{value} that has a
"flag" (assumed to be \code{"<"}) for values that are below the MDL}

\item{mdl_value}{a numeric vector the same length as \code{value} that contains
the MDL values.}

\item{mdl_action}{What to do with values below the detection limit. Options
are \code{"zero"} (set the value to \code{0}; the default), #' \code{"half"} (set the value
to half the MDL), \code{"mdl"} (set the value to equal to the MDL), or \code{"na"} (set
the value to \code{NA}).}
}
\value{
a numeric vector the same length as value with non-detects adjusted accordingly
}
\description{
Set a value where the actual value of a measurement
is less than the method detection limit (MDL)
}
\details{
You must supply either \code{mdl_flag} or \code{mdl_value}, or both. When only
\code{mdl_flag} is supplied, it is assumed that the original \code{value} has been
set to the MDL, and will be adjusted according to the \code{mdl_action}. When
only \code{mdl_value} is supplied then any \code{value} less than that will be
adjusted appropriately using the corresponding \code{mdl_value}. When both
\code{mdl_flag} and \code{mdl_value} are supplied, any \code{value} with a corresponding
\code{<} in the \code{mdl_flag} vector will be adjusted appropriately using the
corresponding \code{mdl_value}.
