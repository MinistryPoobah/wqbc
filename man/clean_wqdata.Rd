\usage{
clean_wqdata(x, by = NULL, max_cv = 1.29,
  messages = getOption("wqbc.messages", default = TRUE),
  parallel = getOption("wqbc.parallel", default = FALSE))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The data.frame to perform the calculations on.}

\item{by}{A character vector of the columns to perform the calculations by.}

\item{max_cv}{A number indicating the maximum permitted coefficient
of variation for replicates.}

\item{messages}{A flag indicating whether to print messages.}

\item{parallel}{A flag indicating whether to use the parallel backend provided by foreach.}
}
\description{
Cleans water quality data. After standardization replicates are averaged.
If there are three or more values with a coefficient of variation (CV) in
exceedance of \code{max_cv} then the value with the highest absolute deviation
is dropped until the CV is less than or equal to \code{max_cv}
or only two values remain. The default value max_cv value of 1.29
is exceeded by two zero and one positive value (CV = 1.73)
or by two identical positive values and a third value an order
or magnitude greater (CV = 1.30). It is not exceed by one zero
and two identical positive values (CV = 0.87).
