\description{
Both the Canadian federal government and the
province of British Columbia set limits for a range of
water quality parameters. The data were taken from a
range of federal and provincial websites. They represent
long-term limits for samples taken from the water column.
Limits which depend on conditions from other periods
or locations are not included. For example some of the
limits for turbidity are defined with respect to background
levels and/or an upstream site.
Where some interpretation of the information provided was required
this is noted in the comments. Units are as defined in the \code{\link{codes}}
data frame.
