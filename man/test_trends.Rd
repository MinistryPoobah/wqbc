\title{Test for Trends in Water Quality Indices}
\usage{
test_trends(x, scale = "Year", by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame with columns WQI and time defined in \code{scale}}

\item{scale}{the time stamp of the observation which must be a named column of \code{x}}

\item{by}{a factor or a list of factors, which must be named columns of  \code{x}.}
}
\description{
Tests for linear and non-linear trends in water quality indices
}
\details{
[DRAFT]

If the argument \code{x} must have columns:
WQI (0 to 100),
Year (or whichever single column is specified by the argument Year).

only one WQI value for each year is allowed.
If a by argument is specified for example if by = c("Lake", "Site")
then a trend test is conducted for each combination of Site
within each Lake by Year

The function returns an object of class wq_trend which inherits from data.frame. It
the will include any columns listed in the \code{by} argument plus any columns which do
not vary for each Trend test (allows things like Lat and Lon to be passed
through for plotting particular sites) plus the columns From and To which give
the first and last Year for each trend test plus the column Values which gives
the actual number of WQI values in the test plus the columns Trend (which
gives the positive or negative net rate of change per scale unit) and
Significance (p-value).

\examples{
# subset data to select only TOTAL LEAD and station "BC08KA0001"
data(waterq)
x <- subset(waterq, station_no == "BC08KA0001" & grepl("LEAD TOTAL", variable_name))

# rescale recorded values to be on common scale (some are MG/L some UG/L)
x $ WQI <- x $ value * ifelse(x $ unit_code == "MG/L", 1000, 1)
# and month and year covariates
x $ month <- factor(month.abb[x $ sample_datetime $ mon + 1], levels = month.abb)
x $ year <- x $ sample_datetime $ year + 1900

test_trends(x, scale = "year", by = "month")
